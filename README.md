# InnoDevOpsCourse

This repo holds the project and the labs for the DevOps Engineering course at Innopolis University (Fall 2021 semester).
The [.vscode](.vscode) folder contains the configuration and recommended extensions for the Visual Studio Code editor, in addition to the [Prettier configuration](.prettierrc) to ensure a consistent code style.
Prettier is used for Markdown and Dockerfile files, while Black is used for Python.

## Subprojects

### Python

In the [app_python](app_python) folder you will find the Python application that is used in the labs.
More details about it can be found in the [app_python](app_python) folder.

## Docker

The projects use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run the application in a container.
Each project has a Dockerfile that defines the image that will be used to run the application.
Checkout the relevent folder for more details.
