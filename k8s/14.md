# Cluster Monitoring and Init Containers

## Kube Prometheus Stack

### Stack components

- [**Prometheus Operator**](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator): A plugin for Kubernetes that makes it easier to integrate Prometheus into our Kubernetes stack. It includes features like Custom Resources and Simplified Deployment Configuration that help simplify and automate the configuration of the Prometheus stack in a Kubernetes cluster.
- [**Prometheus**](https://prometheus.io/): A monitoring system used for collecting and visualizing metrics from applications and storing them in a time-series database that can then be used by tools like Grafana and Loki for logs aggregation and visualization.
- [**Prometheus Alertmanager**](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager): A service for handling and processing alerts sent by applications like Prometheus and forwarding them.
- [**Prometheus Node-exporter**](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter): A tool for collecting and exposing metrics about the node on which it runs. It is mainly used for exporting hardware-related metrics like CPU, memory, disk, network and more, as well as kernel information.
- [**Prometheus Adapter for Kubernetes Metrics APIs**](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/prometheus-adapter): Helps connect between Prometheus and Kubernetes by collecting metrics from Kubernetes APIs (such as information about pods, resources, and nodes) and publishing them in the Prometheus way.
- [**kube-state-metrics**](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics): Similar to the adapter above, but without outputting in the Prometheus way; just raw data and metrics in plain text.
- [**Prometheus Grafana**](https://grafana.com/): A web-based application for visualizing and exploring metrics.
