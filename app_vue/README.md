# Vue 3 application

## Setup

To install dependencies, run:

```
npm install
```

## Run

To run the application for development, run:

```
npm run dev
```

To build the application for production, run:

```
npm run build
```

and then serve the files in `dist` folder using a web server of your choice (ex: `python -m http.server`).
